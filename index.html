          <div class="card-icon">üíº</div>
          <h3>Asset & Unclaimed Funds Recovery</h3>
          <p>We search county records and other government agencies across the United States to hunt down and locate unclaimed funds that belong to individuals and find their rightful owners. Our audits go through accounting records and specify any outstanding payable items that are unclaimed, or on the verge of expiring. If these funds go unclaimed for too long, they are usually lost to the government agency holding them. Through our diligent research, we connect the dots and contact the owners of the property we‚Äôve located. That‚Äôs how we identified and found you.</p>

          <div class="card-icon">üè†</div>
          <h3>Cash For Keys</h3>
          <p>When someone buys a home at foreclosure, they might be willing to put money in the current occupant‚Äôs pocket to avoid the lengthy and costly court proceedings that are often required for eviction.

             We negotiate a written agreement on your behalf that includes a promise from the occupants that they won't vandalize the property or strip the home of light fixtures, appliances, etc., and leave the home in "broom clean" condition in exchange for money to leave by a specified date. 

             The amount of money a new owner typically offers is a few thousand dollars‚Äîenough to cover some of the reasonable expenses involved with moving out. The money is usually given only after a final inspection of the property is completed and the keys are exchanged.</p>

        <article class="card">
          <div class="card-icon">ü§ù</div>
          <h3>Estate Settlements & Claims Processing</h3>
          <p>Through genealogy and an understanding of heirship laws, we locate heirs that would not otherwise be aware that funds were due to them. This is usually done via probate; this process is the general administration of a deceased person's will or the estate of a deceased person without a will.

             Through an expedited process, we complete the administrative steps of settling someone's financial affairs after he or she is deceased.
             
             Our preferred attorneys handle claims-related legal matters, and our team does all the work involved in processing these cases, including through court litigation and appeals when necessary, at no upfront cost to you. The funds are typically ready to be distributed within 120 days, depending on the complexity of the case. Let us handle it; sit back and relax so we can go to work on your behalf!
